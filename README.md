# iTranslate
Translation application made in Swift that can translate up to 9 different languages including Braille!
I made this application for the purpose of learning how to handle JSON data and responses from Restful API's

I used a FREE third party API called yandex to make the translations into the different lnagauges that are supported.

Language support includes: 
  1. French
  2. Russian
  3. Spanish
  4. Chinese
  5. Hebrew
  6. Japenese
  7. Latin
  8. Greek
